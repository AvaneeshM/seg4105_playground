### Stage 2 (Refined)

## Problem:
  -	One of the main issues for people trying to work out is finding and creating workouts and routines tailored to them. By creating a login and signup feature it will allow the user to make personalized workouts and which they can access anytime they log on. Furthermore, they will be able to share their workouts with other users and be able to refer to more experienced gym members. 

## Appetite:
  -	This is a feature that should be done within the 6-week timeframe in which the user should be able to login or sign up as a FitShare user. Login would only require 2 fields (username and password) and sign-up should require few input fields as well. 

## Solution:
  -	Regarding the user interface the login and sign-up page are very simple as they will just contain fields for the user to input information. Then the application will have to authenticate the user and output errors if they exist. When creating the user, they need to be able to add friends and be able to store their own workouts and routines.

## Rabbit Holes:
  -	Must avoid making logins and signing up too complicated such as requiring more user details for signing up. The user just needs to put their name email and password for account creation not necessary to get other personal details.

## No Goâ€™s:
-	Login does not need to consider 2FA for now.
